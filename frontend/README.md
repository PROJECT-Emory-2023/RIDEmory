## Docs

### Features

- [ ] Cohesive, user friendly design
- [ ] Landing page
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] Rides list
- [ ] Watch for rides at a specific time
- [ ] Create a ride request
- [ ] Responsive mobile-friendly UI

### File Structure

- `frontend`
  - `public` (assets not used during compilation such as favicons)
  - `src` (everything used during compilation)
    - `api` (code controlling backend communication)
    - `assets` (assets used during compilation and related exports and styling)
    - `tests` (tests for various components)
    - `components`, `pages` (self explanatory, review React, react-router-dom, components, and pages)
    - There shouldn't be other loose files aside from ones necessary for React to function (such as `App.jsx` or `index.jsx`) here - chances are, any new files could and should go into one of the aforementioned folders

### Setup

In order to work on the project on your own device, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Install Node.js from the link above if you're on Windows or MacOS, following [this guide](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac) - I would recommend the installer for Windows, and homebrew for MacOS. If you're on a Linux distribution, I would recommend using [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#nvm). Restart your terminal and run `node --version` and `npm --version` to ensure you have both installed.

Now, navigate to the `frontend/` directory in your terminal and run `npm i` to install the dependencies used in the project. Once that's done, run `npm start`; if a new window pops up with a working frontend, you are set!

### Testing

To run the frontend, make sure you are in the `frontend/` directory and run `npm start`.

## Getting Started with Create React App (Automatically generated by create-react-app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
