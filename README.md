## Vision

RIDEmory seeks to **ensure a smoother ride-sharing experience for Emory students.** To do so, we provide:
* Automatically compiled ride information
* Easy access to said ride information
* An updated collection of travel information from TSA wait times to estimated Uber/Lyft rates

through both a website and a bot in GroupMe.

### Design

RIDEmory is split into three main components:

* [Frontend](https://github.com/PROJECT-Emory-2023/RIDEmory/tree/main/frontend)
  * Provides anonymous information about upcoming requested rides on both GroupMe and from registered users
  * Allows sorting of rides by date, time (both leaving and flight time), location (to/from)
  * Also provides organized travel information
* [Backend](https://github.com/PROJECT-Emory-2023/RIDEmory/tree/main/backend)
  * Does all the heavy lifting, communicating with the bot to update the database of rides
  * Also compiles travel information and neatly packages it for the frontend
  * Acts as an interface for most compiled information
* [Bot](https://github.com/PROJECT-Emory-2023/RIDEmory/tree/main/bot)
  * Scrapes GroupMe for rideshare information, automatically sending it to the backend
  * Responds to chat commands for information
  * Also acts as an interface to GroupMe for things like message likes, user ID, etc
